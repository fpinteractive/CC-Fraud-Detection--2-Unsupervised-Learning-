# CC-Fraud-Detection--2-Unsupervised-Learning-
Unsupervised Learning to detect anomalies in unbalanced data

BankSim is an agent-based simulator of bank payments based on a sample of aggregated transactional data that can be used for fraud detection research.
BankSim has 180 steps (approx. six months) of data, and we injected thieves that aim to steal an average of three cards per step and perform about two fraudulent transactions per day. We produced 594643 records in total. Where 587443 are normal payments and 7200 fraudulent transactions. Since this is a randomised simulation the values are of course not identical to original data.
